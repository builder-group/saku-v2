### `package.json` structure

The structure of the `package.json` file in this project should adhere to a specific format, as illustrated by the example structure below. This structure is based on the [npm documentation for creating a `package.json` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

```json
{
	"name": "@repo/template",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"private": true, // Or false if package should be published
	"description": "Description of the package or app",
	"keywords": [],
	"homepage": "https://saku.so/?utm_source=github",
	"bugs": {
		"url": "https://github.com/builder-group/saku-v2/issues"
	},
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		"url": "https://github.com/builder-group/saku-v2.git"
	},
	"license": "AGPL-3.0-or-later",
	"author": "@bennobuilder",
	"main": "./dist/cjs/index.js",
	"module": "./dist/esm/index.js",
	"source": "./src/index.ts",
	"types": "./dist/types/index.d.ts",
	"files": ["dist", "README.md"],
	"scripts": {
		"build": "shx rm -rf dist && rollup -c rollup.config.js",
		"build:prod": "export NODE_ENV=production && pnpm build",
		"clean": "shx rm -rf dist && shx rm -rf .turbo && shx rm -rf node_modules",
		"install:clean": "pnpm run clean && pnpm install",
		"lint": "eslint . --fix",
		"start:dev": "tsc -w",
		"test": "vitest run",
		"update:latest": "pnpm update --latest"
	},
	"dependencies": {
		// Project dependencies here
	},
	"peerDependencies": {
		// Project peerDependencies here
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		// Project devDependencies here
	}
}
```

For specific packages, additional fields should be included as shown below. Note that the fields `source`, `main`, `module`, `types`, and `files` are usually required in packages:

```json
{
	// ..
	// "scripts": ..,
	"source": "./src/index.ts", // Entry file (source code)
	"main": "./dist/cjs/index.js", // Entry point (CommonJS)
	"module": "./dist/esm/index.js", // Entry point (ES Module)
	"types": "./dist/types/index.d.ts", // Type definitions
	// ..
	// "devDependencies": {},
	"files": [
		// List of files to be included in your package
	]
}
```

## 🏷️ Naming Conventions

### 📂 File & Folder Naming

- Use **kebab-case** for files and folders (`some-folder/`, `some-file.ts`)
- Use **singular** for categories (`component/`, `layout/`, `config/`)
- Use **plural** for collections (`hooks/`, `utils/`, `tests/`)
- **React components**: `PascalCase` (`Button.tsx`, `UserProfile.tsx`)
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (`User.ts`, `DatabaseClient.ts`)
- **Functions**: `snake-case` (`get-users.ts`, `send-email.ts`)
- Keep names **clear, consistent, and minimal**

### 🧱 App & Package Structure

```
apps/<scope>-<feature>/
packages/<scope>-<feature>/
```

- `scope`: high-level domain or context (e.g. `sfy`, `web`, `api`)
- `feature`: specific unit or functionality (`link-in-bio`, `dashboard`, `core`, etc.)
- Only include `scope` when needed for clarity or grouping

**Examples**:

| Path                    | Purpose                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `apps/sfy-link-in-bio/` | Shopify-specific app    |
| `apps/web-dashboard/`   | Web frontend            |
| `packages/api-core/`    | Shared backend logic    |
| `packages/ui/`          | Shared UI components    |
| `packages/types/`       | Global TypeScript types |

### 📦 `package.json` Naming

```
@repo/<scope>-<feature>
```

Examples:

- `@repo/sfy-link-in-bio-app`
- `@repo/api-core`
- `@repo/ui`

### 🚀 Fly.io App Naming

```
saku-<scope>-<feature>\[-env]
```

Examples:

- `saku-sfy-link-in-bio`
- `saku-api-core`
- `saku-web-dashboard-dev`

### 🌐 Subdomain Naming

```
<scope>-<feature>.saku.so
```

Examples:

- `sfy-link-in-bio.saku.so`
- `api-core.saku.so`
- `dashboard.saku.so` (simplified for user-facing domains)

## 🚀 Deployment & Stages

### Stages

Our project supports multiple deployment stages to ensure proper development and release workflows:

#### Local Stage (`local`)

- **Purpose**: Local development on your machine
- **Environment**: Development environment with hot-reload and debugging capabilities
- **Access**: Only accessible on your local machine (typically `localhost:3000` or similar)
- **Database**: Local database instance or development database
- **Configuration**: Uses local environment variables and development configs
- **Usage**: For feature development, testing, and debugging

#### Production Stage (`prod`)

- **Purpose**: Live production environment serving real users
- **Environment**: Optimized production build with performance optimizations
- **Access**: Publicly accessible via production domain
- **Database**: Production database with real data
- **Configuration**: Uses production environment variables and secure configs
- **Usage**: Serves the live application to end users

> **Note**: Additional stages (dev, qsa, etc.) may be added as the project evolves to support more complex deployment workflows.

## 🗄️ Database Migrations

### Local Development

```bash
# Generate migration for local development (uses dotenv)
pnpm db:generate:local

# Apply migrations to local development (uses dotenv)
pnpm db:migrate:local
```

### Production

```bash
# Production migrations are typically handled by CI/CD deployment pipeline
# Only use these commands locally for special cases (debugging, hotfixes, etc.)

# Generate migration for production
DB_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db pnpm db:generate:prod

# Apply migrations to production
DB_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db pnpm db:migrate:prod
```

### How it Works

- **Local**: Uses `migrations/local` (gitignored), loads `.env.local`
- **Production**: Uses `migrations/` (shared), reads from environment
- **Developers**: Each has isolated local migrations to prevent conflicts
- **Deployment**: Production uses shared migration files
